## FAQs

## Dataset related :

1. Reference DEM: Besides SRTM 30m, may we use other open DEMs such as Copernicus DEM GLO-30 for scale calibration?
-> Yes, you can use any DEM source.

2. Reference data: Will reference LiDAR/DSM data for the urban, sparse, hilly and forested test cases be shared during screening, or should teams use openly available sources?
->You can use any openly available data sources for that.

3. Any reference data will be provided?
-> We will not provide any additional data.


## Model related :
1.  Would a foundation backbone fine-tuned for height be acceptable, or must the backbone be depth-pretrained?
-> You can use anything, but make sure that for GeoTIFF images, the values match DEM heights. For non-GeoTIFF images, relative heights can be at any acceptable scale.

2.  Can we use GAN models rather than depth-pretrained models?
-> You can use any methodology that suits you to produce good results. We have just shown one possible way to achieve the expected results.

## Evaluation related : 

1. Evaluation imagery: Which sensor and approximate spatial resolution will the ISRO RGB images used for final evaluation have (for example, Cartosat at 0.5m/1 m/2.5 m)?
-> Cartosat 2S imageries with resolution of 0.6m will be used for final evaluation.

2. Evaluation target: Will accuracy be assessed on the absolute DSM (terrain + structures) or on above-ground heights of structures (nDSM)?
-> We will provide Geotiff images during evaluation so we will evaluate with absolute DSM such as SRTM or Copernicus. but your solution should accept non-geotiff images too.

3. Whether a suitable georeferenced RGB dataset with corresponding reference DEM/DSM/LiDAR height data will be provided during the final evaluation, or whether teams are expected to source the reference data independently?
-> No, we will only provide georeferenced RGB Images (like tiff files) or normal RGB Images (like png) for inferencing, so team have to source the reference data independently.

4. Is the dataset at https://github.com/IMG-PROCESS-SAC/SIH2026/ representative of what will be used during final evaluation, or will a separate held-out dataset be used for judging?
-> There will be a separate dataset for evaluation.

5. Is there a minimum accuracy/RMSE threshold expected for the DSM estimation, or is scoring purely relative to other participating teams?
-> It is relative to other participants.


## Execution related : 

1. Deployment: Is a locally hosted web application acceptable as a "standalone deployment", or is a desktop executable expected?
-> both are acceptable.

## Presentation related :

1. For the final presentation, would you advise a more technically detailed deck (architecture, loss design, ablations) or one focused on the problem, the output, and measured accuracy, with technical detail minimized?
-> For the initial submission, include only the problem understanding, implementation idea, proposed architecture, and any preliminary work you have done in one extra slide. However, after selection, more detailed technical documentation will be needed.
